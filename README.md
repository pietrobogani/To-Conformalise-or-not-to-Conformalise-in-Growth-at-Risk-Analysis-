# To Conformalise or not to Conformalise in Growth-at-Risk Analysis? Assessing the Empirical Performance of Calibrated Versus Non-Calibrated Quantile Prediction Model
 Repository of the Master Thesis of Pietro Bogani 
- "functions.r" contains the implementation of the CQR algorithm modified for quantile estimation for QR and QRF and for the [A,+inf) and (-inf,B] case
- "Simulation Study" folder contains scripts for running all the simulation, .xlxs files with results and a folder with all the resulting calibration curves plot.
- "Real case" folder (under construction) contains scripts for running all the models and a folder with all the resulting calibration curves plot.
